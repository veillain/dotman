# Dotman
**Dotman** is a very lightweight and simple Dotfile Manager for GNU/Linux operating systems. \
It uses a [single script](src/dotman), written **fully in bash**, which is auditable, requiring **no build and dependencies**. \
Dotman also inspired by **pacman** that archlinux used, which make all the command easy to remember. \
<br/>
These are the **features** dotman have for now:

## Overview
Dotman uses a path that you set to be the dotfiles directories. Then you can manage your configuration into/from dotfiles with simple commands. \
<br/>

1. Create your directory to store the dotfiles:
    ```sh
    mkdir ~/dotfiles
    ```

2. Set the directory you created to be dotman's dotfile path:
    ```sh
    dotman set ~/dotfiles
    ```

3. Add your configuration into the dotfiles
    ```sh
    dotman sync nvim
    ```

4. To remove configuration from the dotfiles:
    ```
    dotman remove nvim
    ```

5. You can run ```dotman syncall``` to sync all configuration inside dotfiles after making some change in current configuration

> [!NOTE]
> you can also sync or remove bunch of configuration in one time: ```dotman sync nvim obsidian rofi foot hypr dunst```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> dotman doesn't apply symlink way to sync. If you want to, you can use 'stow' that really perfect for it.

> [!CAUTION]
> be in mind if you do ```dotman syncall```, the configuration in the dotfiles will be overwrited with modified current configuration
